number = rand(10)

if number == 5
  puts '5 is a cool number!'
else
  puts 'Other numbers are cool too!'
end

# replace = with ==.
# if number = 5 always evaluates to true, because the return value of an assignment is the value used in the assignment and since every value evaluates to true in control flow, except for false and nil.
